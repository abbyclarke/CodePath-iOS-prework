**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Abby Clarke**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Created a settings page
- [X] User can change color theme (light, dark, green, red) in settings
- [X] User can modify the tip percentage amounts in settings

## Notes

I am new to Macs, Swift, Xcode, and app development, so this prework was a fun challenge! After completing the required functionality I found myself doing lots of googling and research to try and implement extra features. I'm excited to learn more!
